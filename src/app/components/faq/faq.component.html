  <h3 class="fact">How does this effort help reduce the impact of money on politics?</h3>
  <p class="answer">Campaign finance disclosure is an essential public accountability mechanism.  Providing public access to this kind of information about the flow of money in elections empowers oversight and accountability in the government decision-making process.  Data transparency is critical to maintaining public trust.</p>

  <h3 class="fact">What are Democracy Dollars?</h3>
  <p class="answer">Democracy Dollars are a method of public financing of elections which can be an effective tool to increase voter engagement, expand opportunity for more community members of diverse experience to run for office and combat the rising influence of money on political outcomings.</p>

  <h3 class="fact">How do Democracy Dollars work?</h3>
  <p class="answer">Candidates receive public funds to finance their campaigns for office. In this program each registered voter would receive (4) democracy dollar certificates worth $25 each to give to the candidate(s) of their choice running for Mayor, City Attorney or City Council.<br/><br/>
    Candidates qualify for public funds by raising a threshold number of small donor contributions and agree to forego big dollar contributions. Once qualified, candidates are able to fund their campaign by asking for and receiving Democracy Dollars from the voters.  This ensures that candidates are beholden to the public they represent and voters have a voice in who makes it to the ballot box.
